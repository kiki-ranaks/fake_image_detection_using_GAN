# fake_image_detection_using_GAN_MODELS
This project focuses on the development of a robust image classification system for detecting fake or manipulated images in a digital environment.
The primary challenge lies in distinguishing between authentic images and those generated by sophisticated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
To address this challenge, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a state-of-the-art deep learning technique for computer vision tasks.
